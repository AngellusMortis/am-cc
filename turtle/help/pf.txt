wrapper around pathfind API

ex:
"pf pos" will print out the turtle's current position
"pf nodes" will print out the current saved nodes
"pf nodes true" will print out the current saved return nodes
"pf save" will save the current position as a node
"pf save true" will save the current position as a return node
"pf reset" will clear all pathfind data and set current position as origin
"pf go 3" will move the turtle forward 3 blocks
"pf go -5" will move the turle backwards 5 blocks
"pf goUp 1" will move the turtle up 1 block
"pf turnTo back" will rotate the turtle to the backwards position (based on origin)
"pf turn left" will rotate the turtle to left (relative to current position)
"pf goTo origin" will move the turtle to the origin point
"pf goToPos 3 1 -2 back" will move the turtle to 3 blocks to the right, 1 block forward and 2 blocks down and then face backwards (all relative to origin)
